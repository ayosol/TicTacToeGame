# TicTacToeGame
This is my first working repository and it's about a project titled Tic-Tac-Toe. This project is the final test in the ALC 2.0 class of Andela. 
The app is to allow the user to select either X or O It should also allow the user to play against the computer. 
It could also allow the user to play against the human.
The app is also to allow the user to choose between 3 by 3 or 5 by 5 board (Although I haven't implemented that due to exams, will add that
once through with my school exams)
